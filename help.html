    <h2> What is Encryptra?</h2><p>
Encryptra is an attempt to detect malwares in Android
devices by utilizing machine learning approach.
</p>
<h2>What is Real Time Scan?</h2>
<p>
Real Time Scan is a feature that enables the anti-malware
application to detect new app installations on the device
and scan them. If enabled, the anti-malware app can
automatically scan newly installed applications. You can
enable/disable this feature in settings. This feature is
enabled by default.
</p>
<h2>What does Scan System Apps feature mean?</h2>
<p>
Scan system apps is a feature that tells the anti-malware
application to analyze system applications also. You can
enable/disable this feature in settings. This feature is
disabled by default.
</p>
<h2>How it works?</h2>
<p>
Encryptra uses permissions and intent-filters to detect
malicious apps. While scanning, it loads the machine
learning model and extracts permissions and intents
from the installed applications on your device. These
extracted features are then fed to the machine learning
model in the form of a vector. The machine learning
model returns a prediction score between 0 and 1 that
denote the degree of maliciousness of the scanned
application. We use this score to classify the scanned
app into one of the following categories:
Safe: The prediction score is less than 0.5.
Malware: The prediction score is greater than 0.75.
Risky: The prediction score is between 0.5 and 0.75.
Unknown: We cannot determine the type of the
application.
